# Litter-Gitter
The goal of this project is to have a working robot that will identify 'trash' within a 8' area using Computer Vision (openCV). The CV software will be running on a Raspberry Pi that will be connected to a camera. The location of the trash will then be sent to an Arduino that will simultaniously receive info from sensors. With this information, the Arduino will determine where it should go to avoid obstacles and collect trash.
